This directory has to be filled with JPEGs for the background image and the avatar of the dialog.

The file `background.jpg` is the background image for the `index.html` page.

For evey dialog that shall be formatted there has to be a file call `DIALOG-background.jpg` and `DIALOG-avatar.jpg` where _DIALOG_ has to be replaced by the dialog name (which is also used for other file and directory names like `DIALOG.jsonl` in the `output/json` directory).

The file `DIALOG-background.jpg` is the background image for the dialog.
The file `DIALOG-avatar.jpg` is the avatar picture for the beginning of the html page of the dialog.

These files will be copied to the output directory by the guestbook formatter.
